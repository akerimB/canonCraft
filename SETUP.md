# InCharacter - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

This is an AI-powered interactive fiction game where players embody iconic literary characters.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- A smartphone with Expo Go app (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

## AI Configuration (Optional)

The game works with mock data by default. To enable real AI story generation:

1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Game Features

âœ… **Working Features:**
- Character selection (Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, Elizabeth Bennet)
- AI-powered story generation (with fallback mock data)
- Dynamic persona scoring system
- Choice-based narrative branching
- Beautiful dark theme UI
- Save/load game state
- Ad placement system (mock implementation)

ðŸš§ **To Be Implemented:**
- Real AdMob integration
- Firebase cloud saves
- More character packs
- Enhanced AI prompting
- User analytics

## Architecture

- **React Native + Expo** for cross-platform mobile development
- **AI Service** (`aiService.js`) - Handles OpenAI API calls with fallbacks
- **Game Context** (`gameContext.js`) - State management and persistence
- **Component-based UI** - Modular, reusable interface components

## Character Personas

Each character has a detailed persona defining:
- Personality traits and motivations
- Speech patterns and worldview
- Canonical knowledge from source material
- Relationship dynamics

The AI uses these personas to generate authentic, in-character scenes and choices.

## Development Notes

- Uses mock AI responses when no API key is provided
- Graceful fallbacks for network/API errors
- Auto-saves game progress locally
- Optimized for mobile user experience

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start:**
- Try `npx expo install --fix` to resolve dependency issues
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`

**AI not working:**
- Check your API key in `.env` file
- Verify internet connection
- Check console for error messages

**Styling issues:**
- Restart Metro bundler
- Check for syntax errors in StyleSheet definitions
