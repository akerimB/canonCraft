# 📚 Session Persistence & Resume Guide

## How Story Sessions Work

The database architecture provides **complete session persistence**, allowing players to save progress and resume exactly where they left off with perfect story continuity.

## 🔄 **Automatic Session Saving**

Every story action is automatically saved:

### **When Saving Occurs:**
