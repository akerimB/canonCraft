## ðŸ›  Technical Architecture

### Core Service: `immersiveMediaService.js`

```javascript
class ImmersiveMediaService {
  // Voice synthesis system
  async generateCharacterVoice(characterId, text, emotionData)
  
  // Ambient audio generation
  async generateAmbientAudio(sceneData, characterId, intensity)
  
  // Visual enhancement system
  async generateEnhancedVisuals(sceneData, characterId, style)
  
  // Comprehensive experience creation
  async createImmersiveExperience(sceneData, characterId, emotionData)
}
```

### Voice Configuration System

**Character Voice Profiles**:
- **Sherlock Holmes**: British Intellectual (Alloy voice, measured pace, analytical tone)
- **Dracula**: Aristocratic Menacing (Echo voice, slow pace, menacing tone)
- **Elizabeth Bennet**: Spirited Refined (Nova voice, lively pace, witty tone)

**Emotion-Adaptive Parameters**:
```javascript
adjustVoiceForEmotion(voiceConfig, emotionData) {
  // Dynamically adjusts pace, pitch, and tone based on:
  // - Primary emotion (fear, anger, sad, happy, thoughtful)
  // - Emotion intensity (0-100 scale)
  // - Context-specific voice characteristics
}
```

### Ambient Audio Architecture

**Theme-Based System**:
```javascript
AMBIENT_THEMES = {
  victorian_london: {
    baseTrack: 'london_fog',
    layers: ['horse_carriages', 'distant_bells', 'cobblestone_steps'],
    intensity: 0.6,
    dynamics: true
  },
  // Additional themes for different literary settings...
}
```

**Intelligent Theme Selection**:
- Character-based defaults (Holmes â†’ Victorian London, Dracula â†’ Gothic Castle)
- Scene context analysis (keywords like "castle", "fog", "estate")
- Dynamic intensity adjustment based on story tension and character emotions

### Visual Enhancement System

**Character-Specific Visual Themes**:
```javascript
VISUAL_THEMES = {
  sherlock_holmes: {
    style: 'victorian_illustration',
    palette: ['#2C3E50', '#8B4513', '#D4AF37', '#696969'],
    lighting: 'gaslight',
    atmosphere: 'mysterious_fog'
  }
  // Unique themes for each character...
}
```

**Dynamic Filter Generation**:
```javascript
generateDynamicVisualFilters(sceneData, emotionData, characterId) {
  // Adjusts visual parameters based on:
  // - Character's base visual theme
  // - Current emotional state
  // - Scene context and atmosphere
  // - Emotion intensity scaling
}
```
