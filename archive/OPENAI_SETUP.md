# OpenAI Integration Setup

Your game has been successfully migrated from Google Gemini to OpenAI! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

- **AI Service**: Updated `aiService.js` to use OpenAI's GPT models instead of Google Gemini
- **Dependencies**: Added `openai` npm package for API integration
- **Configuration**: Now uses OpenAI API keys and models

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy your API key (it starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here

# Optional: Specify the model (defaults to gpt-4o-mini)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

**Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control! Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### 3. Alternative Configuration (For Expo)

If the above doesn't work in your Expo environment, try using:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Available Models

You can use these OpenAI models in your `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable:

- `gpt-4o` - Most capable, higher cost
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Good balance of capability and cost (recommended)
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Previous generation, still very capable
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fastest and cheapest option

## Testing

1. Set up your `.env` file with your API key
2. Start your app: `npm start`
3. The AI will now use OpenAI instead of Gemini
4. If there are any issues, check the console for error messages

## Fallback Behavior

If no API key is provided, the game will automatically fall back to mock responses, so it will still work for testing without an API key.

## Cost Considerations

OpenAI charges per token used. The game is configured with reasonable limits:
- Max tokens per request: 1000
- Temperature: 0.8 (good creativity/consistency balance)
