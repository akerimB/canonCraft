- Motivations: ${characterPack.persona.motivations.join(', ')}
- Key Relationships: ${characterPack.persona.relationships.join(', ')}
- Source Material: ${characterPack.persona.canonical_knowledge}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create an opening scene that establishes the character and setting
2. The scene should feel authentic to the source material but allow for player agency
3. Provide 3-4 meaningful choices that reflect different aspects of the character
4. Each choice should have a clear persona impact (positive for in-character, negative for out-of-character)
5. Include vivid descriptions that immerse the player in the world

Respond in this JSON format:

  "scene_id": "scene_1",
  "title": "Scene Title",
  "narration": "Detailed scene description and narrative...",
  "ad": null,
  "choices": [

PLAYER'S LAST CHOICE: "${choice.text}"
PERSONA IMPACT: ${choice.persona_score > 0 ? 'In-character' : 'Out-of-character'} (${choice.persona_score} points)

CURRENT PERSONA SCORE: ${currentContext.personaScore}/100
TOTAL CHOICES MADE: ${currentContext.totalChoicesMade}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. React to the player's choice naturally within the story world
2. Continue the narrative in a way that feels authentic to ${this.currentPersona.name}
3. Introduce new challenges, characters, or situations
4. Provide 3-4 new choices that test different aspects of the character
5. If persona score is low, perhaps introduce situations where the character can redeem themselves
6. If persona score is high, introduce more challenging moral/character dilemmas

CHARACTER REMINDERS:
- Traits: ${this.currentPersona.traits.join(', ')}
